<!--
  curated service definitions
  subscription driven by global rules and role/team rules

  services could
   - have their own rules
   - subscribe to the rules of other roles
   - be solely tag based for routing, that pushes tags to the edge though
   - could have one set of rules that feed all services, or define each service with its own set of rules

  goals
   - point of integration for external monitoring systems
   - push for tier 1, push notifications to owners
   - curated, defined by the business, with a real SLA and SOP

  how to share alerts
  avoid duplicate notifications
